" The night was clear And the moon was yellow And the leaves came tumbling down I was standing on the corner When I heard my bulldog bark He was barkin' at the two men who were gamblin' In the dark It was Stagger Lee and Billy Two men who gambled late Stagger Lee threw seven Billy swore that he threw eight Stagger Lee (oh Stagger Lee) told Billy, (oh Stagger Lee) I can't (oh Stagger Lee) let you go with that (oh Stagger Lee) You have won all (oh Stagger Lee) my money and my brand new (oh Stagger Lee) (oh Stagger Lee) Stetson hat (oh Stagger Lee) (oh Stagger Lee) (oh Stagger Lee) Stagger Lee (oh Stagger Lee) went home (oh Stagger Lee) And he got his forty-four (oh Stagger Lee) (oh Stagger Lee) Said, I'm goin' to (oh Stagger Lee) the barroom just to pay that (oh Stagger Lee) Debt I owe (oh Stagger Lee) Stagger Lee went to the barroom And he stood across the barroom door He said, nobody move and he pulled his Forty-four, Ooh Stagger Lee, (oh Stagger Lee) cried Billy (oh Stagger Lee) Oh, please (oh Stagger Lee) don't take my life (oh Stagger Lee) I've got three little (oh Stagger Lee) children and a very (oh Stagger Lee) Sickly wife (oh Stagger Lee) (oh Stagger Lee) Stagger Lee (oh Stagger Lee) shot Billy (oh Stagger Lee) Oh, he shot (oh Stagger Lee) that poor boy so bad (oh Stagger Lee) 'Till the bullet (oh Stagger Lee) came through Billy (oh Stagger Lee)and it broke the bar (oh Stagger Lee) (oh Stagger Lee) Tender's glass (oh Stagger Lee) (oh Stagger Lee) (oh Stagger Lee) (oh Stagger Lee) (oh Stagger Lee) (oh Stagger Lee) (oh Stagger Lee) (oh Stagger Lee) (oh Stagger Lee) (oh Stagger Lee) (oh Stagger Lee)"
" Home on The Range Oh give me a home, where the buffalo roam Where the deer and the antelope play, Where seldom is heard, a discouraging word And the skies are not cloudy all day. Home, home on the Range; Where the deer and the antelope play; Where seldom is heard, a discouraging word, And the skies are not cloudy all day. Where the air is so pure and the zephyrs so free And the breezes so balmy and light That I would not exchange my home on the range For all of the cities so bright Home, home on the range Where the deer and the antelope play Where seldom is heard, a discouraging word And the skies are not cloudy all day. How often at night when the heavens are bright With the light of the glittering stars I stand there amazed and I ask as I gaze Does their glory exceed that of ours? Home, home on the range Where the deer and the antelope play Where seldom is heard, a discouraging word And the skies are not cloudy all day..."
" Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal Puff And brought him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff Oh, Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail Noble kings and princes would bow whene'er they came Pirate ships would lower their flags when Puff roared out his name Oh, Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys Painted wings and giant's rings make way for other toys One gray night it happened, Jackie Paper came no more And Puff, that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar His head was bent in sorrow, green scales fell like rain Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane Without his lifelong friend, Puff could not be brave So Puff, that mighty dragon, sadly slipped into his cave Oh, Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee"
"      I was a stranger in the city Out of town were the people I knew I had that feeling of self-pity What to do, what to do, what to do The outlook was decidedly blue But as I walked through the foggy streets alone It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known A foggy day, in London town Had me low, had me down I viewed the morning, with much alarm British Museum, had lost its charm How long I wondered, Could this thing last But the age of miracles, hadn't past For suddenly, I saw you there And through foggy London town, The sun was shining everywhere For suddenly, I saw you there And through foggy London town, The sun was shining everywhere Everywhere Everywhere Everywhere"
 Just because you left and said goodbye Do you think that I will sit and cry Even if my heart should tell me so Darling I would rather let you go Just because you think that you're so smart Going around and breaking lovers hearts Before I let this thing happen to me Darling I would rather swim the sea I know you think you're smart Just going around breaking lovers hearts Just because I want someone who's kind With a heart as good and pure as mine But maybe I am asking far too much Darling please don't ever break my heart I know you think you're smart Just going around breaking lovers hearts Just because I want someone who's kind With a heart as good and pure as mine But maybe I am asking far too much Darling please don't ever break my heart
